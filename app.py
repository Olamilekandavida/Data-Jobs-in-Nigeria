In late September 2023, a pioneering project took flight in Nigeria's data landscape, driven by a quest to illuminate the path for data professionals navigating career choices. Eager to decipher the secrets of employer preferences and industry demands, we embarked on an ambitious mission‚Äîto uncover what employers seek and where they seek it.

Armed with determination but lacking readily available data, we ventured into uncharted territory‚Äîscraping multiple job websites. It was a steep learning curve, but we embraced the challenge wholeheartedly, pioneering a groundbreaking initiative tailored for our unique environment.

Following the arduous data collection phase, we meticulously wrangled the information, preparing it for analysis and visualization. Our goal? Empowering ourselves and fellow data enthusiasts to seize opportunities with strategic foresight.

Now, with Streamlit as our canvas, we proudly present the fruits of our labor‚Äîa testament to persistence and innovation on a remarkable journey. This project is our brainchild‚Äîa labor of love, conceived to redefine how we approach our careers in the data realm.

We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement, striving always to enhance our offering. A heartfelt thank you to Dr. Victor Adekunle for inspiring us to reach higher, and to our dedicated team members‚Äî@genius, @diced_apple, @Oluwafemi, @ofure, @ohlight, @joana, @damilare‚Äîfor their unwavering commitment and collaboration throughout this transformative journey.

Explore our dashboard and discover the insights that await‚Äîyour compass in the dynamic world of data careers.
